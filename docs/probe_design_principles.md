## 2. Candidate Generation (Sliding Window)

Candidates are **implicit** — every position `i` in `[0, len(seq) - oligo_length]` is a potential probe start. There is no explicit list of candidates; instead, the algorithm computes a "badness" score per position and the dynamic programming step selects which positions to use.

### How It Works

For a sequence of length `L` and oligo length `k` (default 20 bp):
- There are `L - k + 1` candidate start positions (indices `0` through `L - k`).
- At each position `i`, the candidate oligo is `seq[i : i + k]`.
- The probe sequence (what you order) is the **reverse complement** of this oligo.

### End Effects

| Position | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `i < 0` | Not considered (array bounds) |
| `0 <= i <= L - k` | Evaluated normally; badness is calculated |
| `i > L - k` | No candidate possible (oligo would extend past sequence end) |

There is no explicit padding or special handling at sequence ends — the sliding window simply stops when there aren't enough nucleotides remaining.

### Junction Handling (Multi-Exon FASTA)

When the input FASTA contains multiple entries (e.g., separate exons), they are concatenated with `>` characters marking junctions:

```
exon1_seq > exon2_seq > exon3_seq
```

The `>` character is treated as an invalid character. Any oligo window that contains `>` receives `badness = inf`, preventing probes from spanning exon junctions.

When extracting the actual probe sequence from a selected position, `>` characters are skipped:
```python
# core.py:373-377
while len(template_region) < oligo_length and j < len(seq):
    if seq[j] != '>':
        template_region += seq[j]
    j += 1
```

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/fasta.py` — `sequences_to_single_string()` performs concatenation.

### Overlap Handling

There is **no hard prohibition on overlapping probes**. Instead, a minimum spacing constraint is enforced by the DP algorithm:

```
minimum distance between probe starts = oligo_length + spacer_length
```

With defaults (oligo_length=20, spacer_length=2), probe starts must be at least 22 bp apart. Since probes are 20 bp long, this creates a minimum 2 bp gap between consecutive probes.

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/core.py:139` — `probe_spacer_len = oligo_len + spacer_len`

---

## 3. Thermodynamic Model

### Reference

Sugimoto et al. (1995), "Thermodynamic Parameters To Predict Stability of RNA/DNA Hybrid Duplexes", *Biochemistry*.

### Nearest-Neighbor Parameters

The model uses 16 dinucleotide stacking parameters for RNA-DNA hybrids:

**Enthalpy ΔH (kcal/mol)** — `thermodynamics.py:20-25`:

| | A | C | G | T |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | -7.8 | -5.9 | -9.1 | -8.3 |
| **C** | -9.0 | -9.3 | -16.3 | -7.0 |
| **G** | -5.5 | -8.0 | -12.8 | -7.8 |
| **T** | -7.8 | -8.6 | -10.4 | -11.5 |

**Entropy ΔS (cal/(mol·K))** — `thermodynamics.py:28-33`:

| | A | C | G | T |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | -21.9 | -12.3 | -23.5 | -23.9 |
| **C** | -26.1 | -23.2 | -47.1 | -19.7 |
| **G** | -13.5 | -17.1 | -31.9 | -21.6 |
| **T** | -23.2 | -22.9 | -28.4 | -36.4 |

**Initialization terms** — `thermodynamics.py:36-37`:
- ΔH_init = +1.9 kcal/mol
- ΔS_init = -3.9 cal/(mol·K)

### Gibbs Free Energy Calculation

```
For an oligo of length k:
  ΔH = Σ(ΔH[dinuc_i]) + ΔH_init    (sum over k-1 dinucleotides)
  ΔS = Σ(ΔS[dinuc_i]) + ΔS_init

  ΔG = (ΔH × 1000 - T × ΔS) / 1000    [kcal/mol]

where T = 310.15 K (37°C)
```

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/thermodynamics.py:45-85` — `thermo_rna_dna(seq)`

### Melting Temperature Calculation

```
Tm = (ΔH × 1000) / (ΔS + R × ln(Ct/4)) - 273.15 + 16.6 × log₁₀(salt)

where:
  R    = 1.9872 cal/(mol·K)     (gas constant)
  Ct   = 50 × 10⁻⁶ M           (primer concentration, 50 µM)
  salt = 0.33 M                 (sodium concentration, 2× SSC buffer)
```

The Tm equation uses the SantaLucia (1998) PNAS form with the OligoCalc salt correction term.

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/thermodynamics.py:83`

---

## 4. Thermodynamic Filtering (F Mask)

The F mask identifies positions where a probe **cannot start** due to thermodynamic reasons. This is purely based on the badness calculation, computed **before** any alignment-based masking.

### Badness Formula

For each position `i`:

```python
oligo = seq[i : i + oligo_length]

if has_invalid_chars(oligo):      # Contains N, X, M, H, P, B, or >
    badness[i] = inf
elif gibbs_rna_dna(oligo) raises KeyError:
    badness[i] = inf
elif ΔG < min_allowable or ΔG > max_allowable:
    badness[i] = inf
else:
    badness[i] = (ΔG - target_ΔG)²
```

**Key points:**
- `badness = 0` is the ideal case (ΔG exactly equals target)
- The badness function is a **squared loss** — probes far from the target ΔG are penalized quadratically
- `badness = inf` means the position is **completely excluded** (no probe can start here)
- The F mask in the output file shows `F` at positions with `inf` badness, and the sequence character at positions with finite badness

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/core.py:47-96` — `calculate_badness()`

### Invalid Character Detection

```python
# sequence.py — has_invalid_chars()
invalid_pattern = re.compile(r'[xXmMhHpPbBnN>]')
```

Characters that trigger `inf` badness: `x`, `X`, `m`, `M`, `h`, `H`, `p`, `P`, `b`, `B`, `n`, `N`, `>`

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/sequence.py`

---

## 5. What Is NOT Checked

The following criteria are **not used** in probe selection or filtering:

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **GC content (%)** | Reported, not filtered | GC% is computed and printed in output but does NOT affect the badness score or filtering |
| **Melting temperature (Tm)** | Reported, not filtered | Tm is computed and printed but does NOT affect scoring; ΔG filtering acts as an indirect Tm filter |
| **Homopolymer runs** | Not checked | No penalty for poly-A, poly-T, poly-G, or poly-C stretches |
| **Self-dimers** | Not checked | No analysis of probe self-complementarity |
| **Hairpins / secondary structure** | Not checked | No folding prediction (e.g., no mfold/UNAfold integration) |
| **Cross-hybridization between probes** | Not checked | Probes are designed independently; no pairwise dimer check |
| **Off-target binding (transcriptome BLAST)** | Not checked directly | Only genome-level repeat filtering (bowtie) and pseudogene filtering are performed; there is no BLAST against the full transcriptome |
| **Probe GC clamp** | Not checked | No requirement for G/C at 3' end |

> **Implication**: The pipeline optimizes purely for thermodynamic uniformity (ΔG close to target) + specificity (avoid pseudogenes, repeats, and repetitive genome regions). Users who need secondary structure or cross-reactivity analysis should run a separate tool (e.g., OligoAnalyzer, NUPACK) on the output probes.

---

## 6. Specificity Filtering (Masking)

All masking is optional and controlled via CLI flags. Masked positions receive `badness = inf`, completely excluding them from probe selection.

### 6A. Repeat Masking (R Mask)

Identifies repetitive elements (SINEs, LINEs, etc.) in the target sequence.

**Three modes:**

| Mode | CLI Flag | Input | How It Works |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Auto-detect | (none — automatic) | N's already in input FASTA | Positions with `n`/`N` are masked |
| Manual file | `--repeatmask-file PATH` | Separate FASTA with N's at repeat positions | Positions where masked file has `N` get masked |
| Automatic | `--repeatmask` | RepeatMasker runs on input | RepeatMasker produces `.masked` file; N positions become masked |

The `--repeatmask` and `--repeatmask-file` flags are **mutually exclusive**.

**Visualization:** In the `_seq.txt` output, the R mask line shows `R` at masked positions and the original sequence character at unmasked positions.

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/core.py:272-292` (R mask creation), `src/probedesign/masking.py:449-571` (RepeatMasker integration)

### 6B. Pseudogene Masking (P Mask)

Identifies regions that align to known pseudogene sequences, which could cause cross-hybridization.

**CLI flag:** `--pseudogene-mask` (requires `--index-dir` or default `bowtie_indexes/`)

**Algorithm:**

1. Generate all 16-mers from the input sequence
2. Align each 16-mer against the pseudogene bowtie index using:
   ```
   bowtie -f -v 0 -k 1 --quiet <pseudogene_index> -
   ```
   - `-v 0`: zero mismatches allowed
   - `-k 1`: report up to 1 alignment (enough to detect any hit)
3. Count hits per position (0 or 1+)
4. Apply threshold: **any hit** (threshold = 0) triggers masking
5. Extend mask: each hit position extends the mask across the full 16-mer window
6. Remove short runs: keep only masked runs of **≥ 18 bp** (min_length=20, tolerance=2)

**Pseudogene index names:**

| Species | Index Prefix | FASTA Source |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| human | `humanPseudo` | `probedesign/pseudogeneDBs/human.fasta` |
| mouse | `mousePseudo` | `probedesign/pseudogeneDBs/mouse.fasta` |
| drosophila | `drosophilaPseudo` | `probedesign/pseudogeneDBs/drosophila.fasta` |
| elegans | `celegansPseudo` | `probedesign/pseudogeneDBs/elegans.fasta` |
| rat | `ratPseudo` | No FASTA shipped (partial support) |

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/masking.py:232-272` — `pseudogene_mask()`

### 6C. Genome Masking (B Mask)

Identifies regions that align to many locations in the genome (repetitive sequences that would cause non-specific hybridization).

**CLI flag:** `--genome-mask` (requires `--index-dir` or default `bowtie_indexes/`)

**Algorithm (triple-stringency):**

The pipeline runs **three separate bowtie searches** at different k-mer lengths and reports back positions exceeding a hit-count threshold:

| Pass | k-mer Length | Max Hits (`-k`) | Threshold | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 12 bp | 5,000 | 4,000 | Catches highly repetitive short motifs |
| 2 | 14 bp | 1,000 | 500 | Catches moderately repetitive regions |
| 3 | 16 bp | 100 | 20 | Catches regions with moderate copy number |

Each pass:
1. Generate all N-mers from the input sequence
2. Align against the genome bowtie index:
   ```
   bowtie -f -v 0 -k <max_hits> --quiet <genome_index> -
   ```
3. Count total hits per position: `num_other_alignments + 1`
4. Positions with hits > threshold get masked (extended across the mer window)

The three masks are combined with **OR logic**: if any pass masks a position, it is masked.

**Genome index names:**

| Species | Index Prefix | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| human | `GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set` | Pre-built from JHU FTP |
| mouse | `mm10` | Pre-built from JHU FTP |
| drosophila | `drosophila` | Build from dm6 or rename pre-built |
| elegans | `celegans` | Build or download |
| rat | `rat` | Build or download |
| cow | `cow` | Build or download |

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/masking.py:275-326` — `genome_mask()`

### 6D. Mask-to-Badness Conversion

After all masks are computed and combined (OR-union), the combined mask is converted to badness scores:

```python
# masking.py:329-352 — mask_to_badness()
for each oligo start position i:
    if ANY nucleotide in seq[i : i + oligo_length] is masked:
        badness[i] = inf
```

This means a single masked nucleotide blocks all oligos that would overlap it.

The mask-derived badness is **added** to the thermodynamic badness:
```python
# core.py:343-349
for i in range(len(badness)):
    if mask_badness[i] == inf:
        badness[i] = inf
```

**Important ordering:** The F mask (in the output visualization) is computed from the **pre-masking** badness. This matches the MATLAB behavior where `mask_string(inseq, badness==inf, 'F')` is called before alignment masking is applied to the badness array.

---

## 7. Dynamic Programming Optimization

### Objective

Find the probe configuration (set of start positions) that **minimizes the average badness** across all selected probes.

### DP Formulation

```
State: bmsf[x][k]   (best solution ending at or before position x, using k+1 probes)
  - bmsf_sco[x][k] = best average score
  - bmsf_pos[x][k] = position of the (k+1)-th probe

Spacing constraint:
  probe_spacer_len = oligo_length + spacer_length
  (consecutive probe starts must be >= probe_spacer_len apart)

Initialization:
  bmsf_sco[0][0] = badness[0]
  bmsf_pos[0][0] = 0

Recurrence (for x = 1..goodlen-1, k = 0..n_probes-1):
  1. Copy forward: bmsf[x][k] = bmsf[x-1][k]

  2. Try placing probe k at position x:
     if k == 0:
       potential_score = badness[x]         # First probe: just its badness
     else:
       prev_x = x - probe_spacer_len
       if prev_x >= 0 and bmsf[prev_x][k-1] exists:
         potential_score = (bmsf_sco[prev_x][k-1] * k + badness[x]) / (k + 1)

  3. if potential_score < bmsf_sco[x][k]:
       update bmsf[x][k] = (position=x, score=potential_score)
```

### Scoring Function

The score is a **running average**:

```
score(k+1 probes) = (score(k probes) × k + badness[new_probe]) / (k + 1)
```

This means the optimization seeks to minimize the **mean** badness, not the sum. All probes contribute equally to the final score.

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/core.py:99-113` — `_calc_score()`

### Backtracking

After filling the DP table, the algorithm backtracks from position `goodlen - 1` for each probe count `k`:
1. Record the last probe position
2. Jump back by `probe_spacer_len`
3. Repeat for `k-1`, `k-2`, ..., `0`
4. Reverse the collected positions

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/core.py:178-202`

### Solution Selection

The DP returns solutions for 1, 2, ..., N probes. The pipeline selects the **solution with the most probes** (last in the list), provided its score is below the rejection threshold (`score < 1,000,000`).

If fewer than N probes can be placed (e.g., too many masked positions), the solution with the most feasible probes is used.

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/core.py:366` — `solutions[-1]`

## 8. Output: Probe Extraction & Reporting

### Probe Sequence

For each selected position `i`:
1. Extract the template region `seq[i : i + oligo_length]`, skipping `>` junction markers
2. Compute the **reverse complement** — this is the probe sequence (what you order from the oligo vendor)

**Code reference:** `src/probedesign/core.py:370-389`

### Output Files

## 10. HCR Probe Mode

Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) probes are longer oligonucleotides (typically 52 bp) with different thermodynamic targets. The pipeline supports HCR probes by adjusting the user-configurable parameters:

**Example HCR invocation:**
```bash
probedesign design input.fasta \
  --probes 20 \
  --oligo-length 52 \
  --target-gibbs -60 \
  --allowable-gibbs -80,-40
```

| Parameter | Standard smFISH | HCR Mode |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Oligo length | 20 bp | 52 bp |
| Target ΔG | -23.0 kcal/mol | -60.0 kcal/mol |
| Allowable ΔG | -26 to -20 | -80 to -40 |
| Number of probes | 48 | Typically 20 |

All other parameters (salt, primer conc, temperature, masking thresholds) remain the same. The DP spacing constraint adjusts automatically: `probe_spacer_len = 52 + 2 = 54 bp`.

**Test case:** `test_cases/EIF1_CDS_HCR/` — achieves ~78% match with MATLAB reference (partial match expected due to DP tie-breaking at equivalent-score positions).

**Code reference:** No special "HCR mode" in the code — it's simply a different set of CLI parameters. The same algorithm runs with different inputs.
